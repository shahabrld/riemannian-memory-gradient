# riemannian-memory-gradient

This repository contains the code for our paper on memory gradient optimization over Riemannian manifolds. It uses the Manopt toolbox.

Files:
- `memorygradient.m`: Memory gradient method implementation
- `linesearch_wolfe.m`: Wolfe condition-based line search
- Scripts for generating tables and figures in the paper

Requirements: [Manopt](https://www.manopt.org)
