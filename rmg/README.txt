This code uses the Manopt toolbox (https://www.manopt.org) to implement a memory gradient method for Riemannian optimization.

The package includes:

	memorygradient.m: Implementation of the memory gradient algorithm.

	linesearch_wolfe.m: A line search routine based on Wolfe conditions.

	Scripts for generating the tables and figures used in our paper.

To run the code, ensure Manopt is installed and included in your MATLAB path, then execute the main script.
